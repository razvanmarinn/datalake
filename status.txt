Made data catalog retrieve file list from dfs master
still need to work on the owner id and project cause they are marked as ingestion service / .. check tomorrow

we can see projects in data catalog, let's improve on that
if i click on another project the same data appears ( from proj 1)
+ fix topic for kafka, right now it is a static mess.

still needs to do that but got the idea
user comes and register project -> kafka topic and a consumer are created specially for that project ( or schema) 
to acheive this we need a CRD for k8s and to do some logic.
evolve the schema registry into a metadata service 
need to clean things out a bit and after we achieve that I would want to implement Trino to read data from our datalake.
